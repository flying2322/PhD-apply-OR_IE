9、Early stage researcher PhD position in ‘fluid ethics and legitimation of newness’ (MSCA-ITN-ETN-860364-LNETN)（奥地利）

At the Faculty of Social Sciences, Aalborg University Business School, a PhD scholarship in Early Stage Researcher (PhD) position in ‘Fluid ethics and legitimation of newness’ (MSCA-ITN-ETN-860364-LNETN) is open for appointment on 1 December 2020 or as soon as possible.

Job Description
Apply now for EU funded support to undertake cutting edge research within a high level European Training Network consortium of four research intensive EU universities. You will benefit from a team approach, integrated international mobility, high level subject and transferable skills development oriented to your future employment in research and the wider economy.

This specific ESR (PhD) position is for ESR4: Fluid ethics and legitimation of newness

ESR4 will develop new conceptual frameworks for understanding fluid ethics. With the Oxford English Dictionary declaring ‘post-truth’ as the word-of-the-year for 2016, the world has entered a new period of fluid ethics. This project will explore three cases to understand how the new forms of emergent fluid ethics impact existing and contribute to the creation of new institutions in these settings: energy & environment, migration & work, and health & nutrition. ESR4 will lay the groundwork for new conceptual frameworks for understanding fluid ethics, which have become important to grasp the role of social media in shaping collective behaviour at all levels, institutional, competitive and individual. She will explore three fields: energy and environment, migration and work, and health and nutrition - to understand how fluid ethics influence existing institutions and contribute to the creation of new institutions. Ethics are crucial not only to our understanding of the relationship between social goals and wealth creation missions, but also of relationships between NGOs and for-profit ventures.

Supervisory team: Romeo V. Turcan (AAU, host), Jillian Gordon (GU), Chris Mould (SHAFT)
